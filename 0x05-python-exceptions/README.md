Overview
In Python, exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They can be caused by various reasons such as runtime errors, logical errors, or external factors.

This repository covers the basics of handling exceptions in Python, including how to catch and handle different types of exceptions, creating custom exceptions, and following best practices to write robust and maintainable code.

Getting Started
To explore the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-exceptions.git
Navigate to the repository directory:

bash
Copy code
cd python-exceptions
Explore the examples in the codebase.

Handling Exceptions
The handling_exceptions.py file contains examples of basic exception handling in Python. It covers:

Using try and except blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
Handling specific types of exceptions.
Using else and finally blocks.
python
Copy code
# Example code snippet
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Handling a specific exception
    print(f"Error: {e}")
else:
    # Code to execute if no exception occurred
    print("No exception occurred.")
finally:
    # Code to execute regardless of whether an exception occurred
    print("This block always executes.")
Custom Exceptions
The custom_exceptions.py file demonstrates how to create and use custom exceptions in Python. It covers:

Creating a custom exception class.
Raising custom exceptions in your code.
python
Copy code
# Example code snippet
class CustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="Custom error message"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

# Raise a custom exception
raise CustomError("This is a custom error.")
Best Practices
The best_practices.md file outlines best practices for handling exceptions in Python. It includes recommendations on:

Using specific exception types.
Properly documenting exceptions.
Avoiding bare except clauses.
Logging and reporting exceptions.
